# song-recommendation-system
Project Overview The Smart Music Recommender System is a Python-based web application designed to suggest songs based on their emotional context and energy levels. Unlike traditional playlist generators that rely solely on artist names, this project utilizes Machine Learning (Content-Based Filtering) to understand the specific "vibe" of a track.
